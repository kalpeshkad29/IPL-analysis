# IPL-analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on comprehensive analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) using multiple datasets that capture different aspects of the tournament. The datasets include ball-by-ball details, match-level information, player statistics, and team-related data, which together provide a holistic view of the league’s performance trends. Using these datasets, various insights have been derived to understand player performances, team dynamics, and match outcomes. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard (IPL_analysis_dashboard 1.pbix) has been developed to provide an interactive and visually rich representation of the analysis, making it easier to explore key findings and patterns within the IPL.
