# IPL-analysis
Project Overview

This project focuses on comprehensive analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) using multiple datasets that capture different aspects of the tournament. The datasets include ball-by-ball details, match-level information, player statistics, and team-related data, which together provide a holistic view of the league’s performance trends. Using these datasets, various insights have been derived to understand player performances, team dynamics, and match outcomes. Additionally, a Power BI dashboard (IPL_analysis_dashboard 1.pbix) has been developed to provide an interactive and visually rich representation of the analysis, making it easier to explore key findings and patterns within the IPL.



Datasets Description

ball_by_ball_data.csv → Contains detailed delivery-level information for every match, including runs scored, wickets taken, and player contributions.

ipl_matches_data.csv → Includes match-level details such as venue, toss results, match results, and participating teams.

players-data-updated.csv → Provides player-level information such as player names, roles, and statistics.

teams_data.csv → Contains team-related metadata including team names and other identifiers.



Dashboard

The project includes an interactive Power BI dashboard:

Features:

1)Player performance comparisons

2)Team-wise and season-wise analysis

3)Insights into toss outcomes, venues, and winning trends

4)Run and wicket distributions



Key Insights (Examples)

1)Identification of top-performing batsmen and bowlers across seasons.

2)Team winning trends based on toss decisions and venues.

3)Comparative player analysis using performance metrics.

4)Match outcome patterns and season-wise breakdowns.



DAX Formulas Documentation

Along with the dashboard, this project also includes a Word document containing all the DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) formulas that were used to build the Power BI visualizations. This documentation provides transparency into the calculations and measures applied in the analysis, such as performance metrics, aggregations, and custom KPIs. It serves as a reference for anyone who wishes to understand the logic behind the dashboard or replicate the same calculations in their own Power BI projects.
